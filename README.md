# Bingo!

## Why?
My family plays Bingo every New Years day.  When a certain quantity of loud drunken italians join the game, it becomes very difficult to hear what numbers have been called.  This application allows any web browser to display the current bingo board.

## Demo
Coming soon!

## Dependencies
This application is built to run on Google's App Engine, and thus all of the dependencies must be copied into the project folder as opposed to installed on your system.
